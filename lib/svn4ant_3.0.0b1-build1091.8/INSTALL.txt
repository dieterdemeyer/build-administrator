INSTALLATION

1. Download and install all required third-party Java packages. Verify
   that each package is properly installed. Currently Ant version 1.8.x,
   AntXtras version v3, and SVNKit version 1.3.x is required for the
   Svn4Ant 3.x distributions.

2. Download, verify, and extract a Svn4Ant distribution. The new
   user should download the '_withdeps' binary distribution that includes
   all required third-party libraries as well as a sample Ant script
   that can be used to verify your installation.

   * To verify the PGP signature of the downloaded archive, get the
     JWare distribution KEYS from http://purl.net/jware/KEYS

   * If you must manually generate all binaries for your environment,
     download the source-only distribution. The included "ez-build.xml"
     Ant build file can generate a default distribution from the source.
     Be sure you configure the "ez-build.properties" file for your
     environment. Read the Svn4Ant download web page for a list of 
     required third-party packages.

3. Update your development and Ant run environment to include the main 
   Svn4Ant jar file in your ANT classpath. The required jar is found
   at <SVN4ANT_HOME>/lib/jw-svn4ant.jar. See the Svn4Ant download web
   page for a complete example that includes loading third-party jar
   files or the admin antlib as well. 

4. Verify Svn4Ant classes are accessible in your ANT runtime environment.
   The easiest way to do this is to try loading the Svn4Ant antlib using
   a simple <taskdef> declaration; the etc/svn4ant-install-check.xml
   script does this for you. To run this script try (from root of the
   <SVN4ANT_HOME> directory of a `_withdeps` installation):
        `ant -f etc/svn4ant-install.check.xml`

5. Read the Svn4Ant Overview on the website for a list of the most used
   antlib components and a set of quick-start examples.
