                         JWare/AntXtras Svn4Ant
                    Version 3.0.0b1, Release Apr 2010
                   -----------------------------------

                            
This document contains the major Svn4Ant version change notes. For the most
recent information, visit the website at http://antxtras.sourceforge.net.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of Svn4Ant represents the migration from a codebase based
on Ant 1.7 and SVNKit 1.1.x to one based on Ant 1.8 and SVNKit 1.3.x. 
Older versions of Svn4Ant are NOT compatible with Ant 1.8 nor SVNKit 1.3, 
so you must use this version if you intend to use either Ant 1.8 or 
SVNKit 1.3.x. 

We have been able to maintain the majority of the Svn4Ant v1 and v2 
options as-is so your scripts should function as expected mostly; however,
SVNKit 1.3 has some significant internal changes from the 1.1 version
and there are some discontinued options or new nuances to existing
ones (like 'recurse' is a now a shortcut for the new, more general  'depth'
option). Incompatible changes are noted below with a [INCOMPAT] prefix.


CHANGES IN 3.0.0b1:
-------------------

=> [KNOWN-ISSUE] The admin components have not been fully migrated in  
   this initial v3 beta. [FS#142]


=> [INCOMPAT] The default antlibs are now the namespace dependent ones.
   For the older-style antlib (where the 'svn' or 'svnadmin' is included 
   as part of the component's name instead of in a namespace you define), 
   use the 'antlib-nons.xml' antlib files. [FS#246]

   EXAMPLE: Load client antlib into the 'jwaresoftware.svn4ant.client'
   namespace:

        <taskdef uri="jwaresoftware.svn4ant.client"
            resource="org/jwaresoftware/svn4ant/client/antlib.xml"
            classpathref="svn4ant.classpath"/>


=> [INCOMPAT] The Svn4Ant install antlibs no longer include the AntXtras
   install antlib automatically. You need to include the AntXtras 
   install antlib separately-- this is needed to ensure you can load
   each antlib into its own namespace ('svn' vs 'oja'). [FS#247]
   
   Additionally, the Svn4Ant install antlibs expect the AntXtras namespace
   to be linked to the uri 'jwaresoftware.antxtras' in order to load
   the Svn4Ant function shortcuts properly.

   EXAMPLE: Load the AntXtras antlib into the 'jwaresoftware.antxtras'
   namespace and the client antlib into 'jwaresoftware.svn4ant.client' 
   namespace. 

        <taskdef uri="jwaresoftware.antxtras"
            resource="org/jwaresoftware/antxtras/install/antlib.xml"
            classpathref="jware.classpath"
            loaderref="jware.classloader"/>

        <taskdef uri="jwaresoftware.svn4ant.client"
            resource="org/jwaresoftware/svn4ant/install/antlib.xml"
            loaderref="jware.classloader"/>


=> Svn4Ant now recognizes working copies created by newer Subversion
   1.5 and 1.6. As with Svn4Ant v1 and v2, Svn4Ant v3 will automatically
   upgrade working copies to the newest format UNLESS YOU TELL IT NOT
   TO USING THE TWO SYSTEM PROPERTIES SHOWN BELOW. You can pick "groups"
   of accepted formats using the "pre-svn15" and "pre-svn16" values for
   the accepted formats. [FS#142]

   EXAMPLE: Tell Svn4Ant to manage working copies created by Subversion
   1.3 or 1.4-- without forcing upgrades to the newest 1.6 format. Note
   that if you CREATE a working copy it will be in the newest format
   allowed by your instructions; in this case the 1.4 format.

        -Djware.antxtras.defaults.svn4ant.wc.upgradepolicy='keep'
        -Djware.antxtras.defaults.svn4ant.wc.acceptedformat='pre-svn15'

 
=> [INCOMPAT] The 'ignoreexternals' option is no longer supported for the
   <svn:update> task.


=> [INCOMPAT] The <svn:delete> operation now deletes items (including
   directories) that are not under Subversion control even if the force
   option is set to "false". In v2 you had to explicitly turn the force
   flag "true" to have <svn:delete> affect unversioned objects. So if 
   a local-only item exists, <svn:delete> will remove it unconditionally
   unless you specify the 'removefiles=no' option.
